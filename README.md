## DRSM Personal Website

A new portfolio is always a perfect time to test ourselves and see how independent we are when delivering solutions.

I wanted to implement technologies that I haven't, and dive into new concepts for me such as the NextJS app router and adding CI/CD pipelines using Github actions and Vercel preview links.

Besides that, I incorporate some helpful tools to the repo like husky (pre-commit), prettier and eslint. They allows us to get a better consistent, readable and stable code without too much effort. So as you can imagine, it was a short but quite rewarding project :muscle:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Roboto Serif and Jacquard12, they're custom Google Fonts.
