            "description": "At Litebox, a boutique software company focused on high-quality product and code, I contributed in the projects working with technologies such as Strapi, Next.js (App and Pages Router), NestJS, Tailwind and Framer Motion.\nOne of my key projects was to create an internal CLI tool to streamline Strapi/Next.js blog setup, and managed form handling with server actions, useActionState, and react-hook-form. I implemented complex state management using Context, Zustand, and other React state management patterns, while also reviewing code, documenting components in Notion.\nEvery time I needed to create a marketing website I worked on ensuring accessibility (WCAG 2), strong SEO practices (structured data, Open Graph, Twitter Cards), and consistently achieving Lighthouse scores above 90. Additionally, I integrated marketing tools like Marketo, Hotjar, and FB Pixel, and handled deployments using AWS services (ECR, ECS, EC2, S3). I also set up dev tooling (Prettier, ESLint, Turbo, and Husky), wrote backend tests with SuperTest, and enforced CI/CD via GitHub Actions. Styling was done with Tailwind, Styled Components, or CSS Modules, depending on the project needs.\nBesides my frontend background here, I also worked on a big real-state project more backend-focused based on NestJS, SQL, TypeORM, Typescript, Next, React and Tailwind. Form handling was managed using react-hook-forms and useActionState hooks. For role handling we based our logic in RBAC rules."

I also took part in maintaining and refactoring the institute's broader suite of back-office applications.\nThe other project involved the need of a WhatsApp bot to sending automated reminders, notifications, and academic updates to students based on their enrollment and progress, helping improve communication and engagement."
